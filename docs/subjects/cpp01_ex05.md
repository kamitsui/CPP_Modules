Do you know Harl? We all do, don’t we? In case you don’t, find below the kind of comments Harl makes. They are classified by levels:

* "DEBUG" level: Debug messages contain contextual information. They are mostly used for problem diagnosis.
> 
> Example: "I love having extra bacon for my 7XL-double-cheese-triple-pickle-special-ketchup burger. I really do!"

* "INFO" level: These messages contain extensive information. They are helpful for tracing program execution in a production environment.
> Example: "I cannot believe adding extra bacon costs more money. You didn’t put enough bacon in my burger! If you did, I wouldn’t be asking for more!"

* "WARNING" level: Warning messages indicate a potential issue in the system. However, it can be handled or ignored.
> Example: "I think I deserve to have some extra bacon for free. I’ve been coming for years, whereas you started working here just last month."

* "ERROR" level: These messages indicate that an unrecoverable error has occurred. This is usually a critical issue that requires manual intervention.
> Example: "This is unacceptable! I want to speak to the manager now."
